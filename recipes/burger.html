            <li>Place the bread in a toaster set to your desired level of darkness. Heat a skillet over medium-high heat.
                Fry the hamburger patty for about 5 minutes per side, until cooked through.
                While the patty is cooking, spread mayonnaise on one side of each piece of toasted bread and place them on a plate, mayonnaise side up.
            </li>
            <li>Once the patty is cooked through, transfer it to one slice of bread.
                Crack the egg into the skillet and fry it until the yolk is firm, about 3 minutes if you cover the pan.
                Place the egg onto the patty when done and top it with a slice of cheese.
                Top with the other slice of bread. When finished, it should look like a sandwich
